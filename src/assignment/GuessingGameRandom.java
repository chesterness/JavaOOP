        //Create a guessing game, this time the number must not be hardcoded, but generated randomly: 1. User types a number 2. program prints out "correct" or "not correct" depending on the number entered 3. if the number is not correct, program promts the input again 4. go to 1.
        //Hints:
        //3.0. Use the solution from previous tasks.
        //3.1. Initialise the memorised value with the random function: Random rand = new Random(); int rand_int1 = rand.nextInt(1000);
        //3.2. Use while loop to repeat asking for a number.
        //3.3. Exit criteria would be a correct number.
